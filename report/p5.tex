Alloy density:
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:03}
    \rho &= \dfrac{4(\sum x_i * M_i)}{N_A\left(a_{\gamma}^3f_\gamma+a_{\gamma'}^3f_{\gamma'}\right)}
\end{align}

The molar fraction of the elements of the Ni-Al-Ta-Cr-Re-W-Co alloy was obtained using \textit{ThermoCalc}. With these values and using equation \ref{eq:03}, the density of the alloy was calculated using \textit{Python}. The results are presented in table \ref{tab:} in the Appendix section \ref{appendix}.

From the results obtained, the average and minimum density wer calculated:
